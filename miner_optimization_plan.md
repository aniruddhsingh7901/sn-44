# Score Vision Miner Optimization Plan for 2x4090 Server

## Current Performance Issues Identified

1. **Single GPU Utilization**: Only using one GPU despite having 2x4090s
2. **Sequential Frame Processing**: Processing frames one by one instead of batching
3. **No Model Optimization**: Using default YOLO settings without optimization
4. **Memory Management**: Not optimizing GPU memory usage
5. **Single Lock System**: Only one challenge processed at a time

## Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Multi-GPU Utilization
- **Current**: Single GPU processing
- **Optimized**: Distribute workload across both 4090s
- **Expected Improvement**: ~80-90% performance increase

### 2. Batch Processing
- **Current**: Frame-by-frame processing
- **Optimized**: Process multiple frames simultaneously
- **Expected Improvement**: 3-5x speed increase

### 3. Model Optimization
- **Current**: Default YOLO inference settings
- **Optimized**: TensorRT optimization, half-precision, optimal batch sizes
- **Expected Improvement**: 2-3x speed increase

### 4. Concurrent Challenge Processing
- **Current**: Single challenge lock
- **Optimized**: Process multiple challenges simultaneously
- **Expected Improvement**: 2x throughput increase

### 5. Memory and I/O Optimization
- **Current**: Standard video loading and processing
- **Optimized**: Async video loading, memory pooling, optimized data structures
- **Expected Improvement**: 20-30% speed increase

## Target Performance Goals

- **Current Estimated**: ~22 seconds (based on single 4090 benchmark)
- **Optimized Target**: <1.5 seconds (well under 2-second requirement)
- **Competitive Advantage**: Significantly faster than top miners (0.8-1.2s range)

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Multi-GPU setup and batch processing
2. **Medium Priority**: Model optimization and concurrent processing
3. **Low Priority**: Memory and I/O optimizations

## Expected Competitive Position

With these optimizations, your miner should achieve:
- **Speed Score**: Near maximum (exponential reward for faster processing)
- **Quality Score**: Maintained or improved through better resource utilization
- **Availability Score**: Improved through concurrent processing capability
- **Overall Ranking**: Top 3 potential with <1.5s response times
